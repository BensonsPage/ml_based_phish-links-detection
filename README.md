# phish-links-detection

## This repo implements a solution for detecting phishing links using neural networks' multi-layer perceptron

## Getting started
git clone https://gitlab.com/ml621625/phish-links-detection
cd phish-links-detection
### Ensure you have python 3.8 ++

## Training the model
python3 dnn_model.py
### Close data visiualization chats as they get presented

## Inferening a single link using the trained model
python3 detect.py
### To infer a single you URL, you need to first convert the dictonary into the right data format as highlighted on detect.py
